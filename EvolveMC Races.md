# EvolveMC Races

<p>
EvolveMC Races is a plugin adding different races to the Minecraft Game, which you can swap between at any time. These races come with special effects being both good and bad, giving every player a fair playing field.
<br>
With these races you are able to collect Experience Points by doing certain actions and use these Experience Points to unlock different skills for your race, some making you stronger, some helping neglect your downsides.
